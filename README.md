## Project Overview
This project was developed during the first Hackathon organized by the company I work for - _Driva_ -  with a focus on market intelligence. Each team was challenged to create a dashboard that could generate business insights for a hypothetical client from a specific sector — such as technology, industry, or services.

Our team (called DASA, for Data Agro Sul Analytics) was assigned to the "industry" category and chose to focus on the **agribusiness sector**. We worked with a recently added internal data source that had not yet been deeply explored, aiming to uncover meaningful patterns and support strategic decision-making in the agribusiness market.


## Challenges

This project was guided by previously identified business pain points and involved overcoming some technical challenges during development.

### Business Context
- A known difficulty in the commercial process was identifying the focal contact persons responsible for each farm.
- Clients had expressed demand for detailed information about farms located in southern Brazil, especially for market analysis and prospecting.

### Technical Challenges
- Managing a large volume of data from multiple databases, which required careful integration and performance optimization.
- Processing geospatial data in GeoJSON format that mapped various crop types per farm, and finding ways to present this visually in a way that provided actionable insights.
- Cross-referencing CAR and CPF/CNPJ data with revenue and market segment information to identify and qualify potential clients.
- Displaying information about farm owners and stakeholders while protecting personal data and ensuring compliance with LGPD (Brazil’s General Data Protection Law).

## Findings

Through the data exploration and dashboard development, we uncovered several relevant insights, such as:

- Number of rural properties identified in the analyzed region.
- Market segmentation using CNAE codes to classify property profiles.
- Total area occupied per property and the types of crops cultivated.
- Details about crop types and ownership structures within rural modules.
- Cross-referencing client and lead data to understand market potential and penetration.

These insights helped us better understand the agribusiness landscape and explore opportunities for data-driven commercial strategies.

## Dashboards

We focused on creating intuitive and user-friendly dashboards, ensuring easy navigation and effective filtering across different pages. The UI was designed with the company’s primary colors (blue and orange) in mind, enhancing visual identity while allowing users to seamlessly explore the data. This design made it simple to drill down into specific insights, tailored for our hypothetical client in the agribusiness sector, **AgroTech**.

## Final Thoughts

This project was a valuable learning experience, enhancing my skills in technical areas such as the ETL process and data modeling. Additionally, it allowed me to strengthen my project management and teamwork skills, collaborating closely with Monique and João to overcome challenges and deliver a functional solution under tight deadlines. Special thanks to them for their hard work and dedication throughout the competition, especially considering the need to balance work commitments with time devoted to this project.
